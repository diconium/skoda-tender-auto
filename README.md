## Design Considerations
 
### User Interface
- **Material Design**:  
  - Integrated Android's Material Design components like `MaterialButton`, `TextInputLayout`, `RecyclerView`, and `CardView`.
  - Applied Material themes through `Theme.MaterialComponents.*` in `styles.xml`.
  - Used Google’s Material Design library for predefined styles and components.
 
- **Responsive Layout**:  
  - Designed to support various screen sizes and orientations using `ConstraintLayout`.
  - Created separate XML layout files for different configurations (e.g., `res/layout`, `res/layout-large`).
  - Used **ViewModel** and **LiveData** to handle configuration changes smoothly.
 
- **Accessibility**:  
  - Enhanced usability for individuals with disabilities, supporting screen readers and high-contrast themes.
  - Added content descriptions for critical visual elements.
  - Used `sp` units for text sizes, with `android:autoSizeTextType` in `TextView` for text scaling.
 
### Performance
- **Optimized API Calls**:  
  - Minimized latency through efficient API handling.
  - Implemented caching strategies, using OkHttp’s caching for offline network responses.
 
### Security
- **Secure Network Communication**:  
  - Enforced HTTPS for all network communication to ensure data protection.

## Integration
 
### Third-Party Services
 
- **Local Data Storage**:  
  - Used Room Database for local caching of user preferences and vehicle data.
 
### Backend API Integration
- **Retrofit**:  
  - Employed for efficient HTTP communication.
- **OkHttp**:  
  - Manages network requests, with GSON used for parsing JSON to facilitate smooth backend API integration.

## Testing
 
- **Testing Configuration**:  
  - Configured with JUnit and Espresso dependencies to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
